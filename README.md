# What I Learned In Week 2 at Code Immersives

Week 2's focus was mainly on CSS _Flexbox_ & _Grid_ with a introduction to Wireframing.

## _Flexbox_

CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional display method to display the flex items in rows and columns. It helps to arrange, shrink, add space in a specified manner. In essence, it provides control over the items and their dimensional appearance. It is a module and not a property to use directly; there is a parent element (flex container) and the child element the flex items.

CSS Flexbox makes it easier to design a layout structure without using float or positioning. It is nice to use both individually but each has its limitations and sometimes is very annoying to use. However, Flexbox is very useful for some cases, few of them mentioned below:

1. Both Horizontal and vertical alignment of a block inside a div
2. Giving equal spaces between the multiple div
   Adjusting height/width dynamically based on the height/width of its parent element
3. Aligning the elements to the baseline, center line or the top line of the division

Although these are the major use cases, flexbox has many other possibilities.

## _Grid_

CSS Grid lets you work along two axes: horizontally and vertically. Grid allows you to create two-dimensional layouts where you can precisely place grid items into cells defined by rows and columns.

CSS Grid focuses on precise content placement. Each item is a grid cell, lined up along both a horizontal and a vertical axis. If you want to accurately control the position of items within a layout, CSS Grid is the way to go.

## _Summary_

1. Grid can do things Flexbox can’t do.
2. Flexbox can do things Grid can’t do.
3. They can work together: a grid item can be a flexbox container. A flex item can be a grid container.

Flexbox is for one dimensional layout. A row OR a column. Grid is for two dimensional layout. Rows AND columns.

## _Wireframing_

a wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. Wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors. As a wireframe usually represents the initial product concept, styling, color, and graphics are kept to a minimum. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally, depending on how much detail is required.

I used Excalidraw to make a wireframe of the GrubHub homepage.

## _GitHub_

I learned how use GitHub & fork repositories, make changes.

- git clone
- git add <FILE_NAME> \*to add a single file
- git add -A \*add all changed files
- git add . \*add all files and changes without the deleted files
- git commit -m "The Commit message"
- git push
